it might be hard to have an inventory in the game. My idea is that when you reach a certain area the game automatically
assumes you have the item in your possesion. That way if the inventory is too hard to code then this would be a good
work around.

That could work if we don't want to do an inventory
Originally I thought that we could use the items in the inventory for attack stats, how would we handle that -SD
